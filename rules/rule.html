                    1. No using any kind of hacks. Some client side mods are allowed, such as optifine, replay mod, minihud, litematica, etc. Ask if unsure!
                    <br>
                    2. No griefing/stealing. Obviously can be stretched, but only to a limit. Just treat others how you would want to be treated.
                    <br>
                    3. No starting drama (rp is fine). Just ask questions and work through problems like an adult.
                    <br>
                    4. PvP is only allowed when both parties consent.
                    <br>
                    5. Stick to build theme in themed areas. If you are unsure if an area is themed, just ask! We are always happy to help!
                    <br>
                    6. No politics. Please keep it to yourself.
                    <br>
                    7. Cussing is okay, but stay mature. No name calling or anything related.
                    <br>
                    8. No using slurs. This includes racism/sexism/etc..
                    <br>
                    9. Please don't spam. It is not nice.
